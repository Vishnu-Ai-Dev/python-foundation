#tuple first understanding program

'''h=(45,"vishnu","bad guy")
print(h[0])
print(h[2])'''

#A slight edited version it prints line by line i edited with printing two in single line 

'''h=(45,"vishnu","gojo")
print(h[0],h[2])'''

#night code simple work

'''h=(1,2,3)
print(h[1])'''

#my morning first code
'''nums={2,3,4,5,6,8}
print(nums)'''

#edited version with more operation

'''h={"gojo","sukuna","yuji"}
g={"ichigo","aizen","gojo"}
print(h.union(g))
print(h.intersection(g))'''

#with numbers for the difference operation

'''h={20,30,40,50}
g={40,30,80,90}
print(h.difference(g))'''

#night practise for removal of duplicate operations

'''nums=[2,3,3,4,5,4,3,6,7,5,9,4,9]
unique_numbers=set(nums)
print(unique_numbers)'''

'''char=["gojo","yuji","dazai","gojo","yuji","aizen","ranpo"]
unique_char=set(char)
print(unique_char)'''
